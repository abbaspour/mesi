1. tstack structure should change. we dont need to add N temps in it in the
beginning, but to let pop to add new temps when it reaches the bottom.

2. Add RegiserManager class and AddresDesc to SymbolTable
			 mov r0, a
	a := 2   ===>    mov r0, 2   =====> mov r0, a

3. Change gencode, draw_tree, print_tree. Use Polymorphism to have just one
function and do aproperate task, based on classes worker function

4. modify swap and push , pop to be fail tolerent

5. use offset and [BP+offset] rather than variable name cuz its the right way
